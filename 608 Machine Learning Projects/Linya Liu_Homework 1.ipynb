Using the historical data from loans that were issued on LendingClub between 2008 and 2012, we can even analyze `how the average returns of investor increase from such informed prediction in the context of peer-to-peer loan investments` after we know additional data such as **annual interest rate** and **lending periods**."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"MVoMZgBDeRSG","colab_type":"text"},"source":["## Benefits of Prediction\n","\n","Before answering the question, I performed a company research. Founded in 2007,  San Francisco-based [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com/) solved the pain point as one of the leading FinTech unicorns, which enables consumers and small business owners lower the cost of their credit and enjoy a better experience than traditional bank lending, and investors earn attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n","\n","The online platform has two primary business segments. The company not only allows its clients to borrow, but also provides an avenue for its other clients to invest in the loans being provided. Below are a simplified process how clients can borrow a loan:\n","1. Clients interested in a loan complete a simple online application\n","2. LendingClub leverages online data and technology to quickly assess risk, determines a credit rating, and assigns appropriate interest rates\n","3. Qualified applicants receive offers in just minutes and can evaluate loan options with no impact to their credit score\n","4. Investors ranging from individuals to institutions procure notes which match up to fractions of loans and select loans in which to invest in a hope of earning monthly returns\n","\n","This automated prediction can help this FinTech unicorn to confront both from the financial and legal doomsay. On the one hand, both [The Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cashing-in-on-fintech-unicorns-is-harder-than-it-seems-11576533185) and [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2019/12/05/created-to-democratise-credit-p2p-lenders-are-going-after-big-money) expressed the high cost of acquiring customers and the hardiness to cash in.

[LendingClub](https://blog.lendingclub.com/lendingclub-responds-to-federal-trade-commission-complaint/)  currently holds a tough tone to claim that \"the allegations in the FTC’s complaint are legally and factually unwarranted.\" However, a **strategic direction** I would suggest is to `select credible clients based on prediction and prepare for rules to protect those clients` to avoid future escalated ligitation.\n","\n","To sum up, this prediction might be useful for a scenario like, \"investors would like to send money to borrowers with high credibility to get high returns.\" Therefore, two ways of benefits include:\n","- Is the borrower credible?\n","- Are the investors going to make money by that?\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"8jV6x5r_y5CB","colab_type":"text"},"source":["# Question 2: \n","Train a decision tree classifier to predict loan acceptance based on the features provided.
